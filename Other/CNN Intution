CNN : convolutional neural network 

A- Special Kind of neural network commonly used for image classification
B- Regular Neural Nets donâ€™t scale well to full images
C- Full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.
D- Convolutional Neural Networks take an input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. 
* depth here refers to the fact that the image consists of 3 matrices ( Red, Green, and Blue)

Simple Simulation : Input Image (weight*hight*3) --> Conv layer ( weight*height* number of filters ) --> pooling (weight/ratio * height/ratio * number of filters )  --> fully connected network --> number of neurons equal to number of classes --> output ( result )
 
CNN Summary: 

1 - It is best suited for image but can also be used in classification and nlp 
2 - It consists of different types of layers so that it can calculate optimally (accuracy & speed)
3 - It has mainly three types of layers : Conv layer, Pooling layer, Fully connected layer, dropout
4 - It requires specific type of activation function
5 - Images will be fitted in the input layer as W*H*3 (3D) as it consists of R, G, and B matrix ( RGB for each pixel ) 
6 - Conv layer: consists of filters that later applied to slices of images to calculate dot product 
7 - Pooling layer : reduces ( down-sampling ) the dimension for the input to only capture the important features (can be done by maxpooling or averagepooling) 
8 - fully connected network : after features extraction and dimensionality reduction, we make a structure of a basic neural network to begin the classification
9 - dropout layer reduces overfitting by "dropping out" a random set of neurons during training. This means that the connections to certain neurons are multiplied by 0
10- last layer must have a number of neurons that is equal to the number of classes   
11- filters are responsible for detecting feaures ( edges, corners, colors, objects or any other common factor) 
12- when feature number are bigger than needed, it causes overfitting ( but still can be handled )
